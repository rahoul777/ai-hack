AI-Powered Smart Workforce Allocation & Timesheet Optimizer
An AI-driven platform that intelligently automates workforce allocation (matching associates to projects) and timesheet management.
It leverages AI/ML + generative AI to:

Recommend best-fit associates based on skills, availability, and project requirements.

Auto-suggest timesheet entries from calendar meetings, code commits, task trackers (e.g., JIRA), and emails.

Detect anomalies in timesheet (overbooking, under-reporting, compliance issues).

Provide real-time dashboards for managers on utilization, bench, and predictive resourcing needs.

Challenge/Business Opportunity & Scalability

Challenges Today:

Manual timesheet entry → errors, delays, and low compliance.

Sub-optimal allocation → wrong skill match, higher bench cost.

Lack of predictive view for upcoming resourcing needs.

Business Opportunity:

Save thousands of hours across TCS by automating timesheet capture.

Improve resource utilization rate by 10–15% with AI allocation.

Can be scaled across TCS internally and also offered as a workforce optimization product to large clients.

4. Novelty, Benefits & Risks

Novelty:

Combines generative AI (LLM) for smart timesheet auto-filling with predictive AI (ML models) for workforce forecasting.

Cross-integration with enterprise tools (Ultimatix, JIRA, Outlook, GitHub).

Personalized nudges → “You worked 6 hrs on Project A today, do you want to auto-fill timesheet?”

Benefits:

30–40% reduction in manual effort.

Increased compliance & accuracy.

Higher utilization and reduced bench cost.

Risks:

Timesheet privacy → mitigate via access control & encryption.

Resistance to change from employees → mitigate via human-in-loop approval.

5. Responsible AI Principles Adherence

Security: End-to-end encrypted data, integration with TCS SSO.

Fairness: Allocation recommendations unbiased across geographies, genders, or roles.

Privacy: No personal productivity micromanagement, only project-level insights.

Legal Compliance: Adheres to client contract terms, local labor law compliance for timesheet regulations.
